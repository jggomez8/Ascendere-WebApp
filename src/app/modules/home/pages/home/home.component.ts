  GitHub supports many extras in Markdown that help you reference and link to people. If you ever want to direct a comment at someone, you can prefix their name with an @ symbol: Hey @kneath â€” love your sweater!

  But I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:

  - [x] This is a complete item
  - [ ] This is an incomplete item

  When you include a task list in the first comment of an Issue, you will see a helpful progress bar in your list of issues. It works in Pull Requests, too!

  And, of course emoji!
